# JavaFXgame---version-1.0-RTgame-First-Edition-
This a simple JavaFX and Java Game that we created for our college project in Java. Game is simple but the code is...Bruh ! Its Massive. (Just 1500+ Line of code). This game is hybrid version. It is inspired by mario game and works as dino game. Although it is just a sample version with all enough functionality.
